# Directory contains examples for each use case directly tested during development and troubleshooting

Within each daughter directory is the example input pdbFile and sdfFile used to test each use case, the python script which imports our codebase and calls the respective functions for performing the desired simulation

1. P-L

Example use case scripts for Protein-Ligand simulations in which the end user defines any of the restraint contexts: 'None', 'AHR','BBR','3DS'

2. Apo

Example use case scripts for Apo protein simulations in which the end user defines any of the restraint contexts: 'None', 'AHR', 'BBR', '3DS'

3. Lig

Example use case scripts for Ligand only in which the end user defines either 'None' or 'AHR' restraints
