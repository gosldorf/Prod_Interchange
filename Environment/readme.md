# This directory contains files related to defining the conda environment to which this code was developed

There are three files in here:

1. environment.yml

Yaml file which can be used to initialize a new conda environment directly. The file does not explicitly contain versions for each library package. If something doesn't work properly see the text files below for explicit definitions of library versions

2. conda.txt

Output of `conda list`

3. pip.txt

Output of `pip list`
